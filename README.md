* headers: use with (#), number of hashtags sign to the number of header, example: ##### heading that mean the header is number 4.

## Git:

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it, and Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.

 

* Seeing Your Remote

By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
