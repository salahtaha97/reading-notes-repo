## Operators
JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
* A *binary* operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
* A *unary* operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.

### Loops
There are many different kinds of loops, like : (for) and (while).

* (for) A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
* (while)  while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
